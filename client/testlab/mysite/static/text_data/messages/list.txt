Booting up the vector machine... 🚀
Still booting... got snacks? 🍿
Still... cranking the vector handle... 😤
Are we there yet? No? Figures... 🐌
40 seconds? Could've grown a beard... 🧔
Thinking of taking up yoga... 🧘‍♂️
At this point, even paint's embarrassed... 🎨
Hang tight, summoning digital spirits! 👻
Spirits on break, please hold... ☕
Ever watched grass grow? Me neither... 🌱
So close, yet so vector... 🎯
Ta-da! Art, finally! Sorry for the eternity... 🥳
